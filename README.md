#BLE P click#
##By [MikroElektronika](http://www.mikroe.com)


BLE P click carries a nRF8001 IC for adding a Bluetooth 4.0 (alternatively known as Bluetooth Low Energy) peripheral device to your design. BLE is an essential feature of today's "smart" gadgets. Its low energy consumption makes it ideal for devices for sport and fitness, proximity sensors, smart watches and so forth. Newer smartphones, tablets and computers have hardware and software support for BLE. To get you started with BLE P click, use our BLE Android app (works on devices with hardware and software support for BLE). BLE P click communicates with the target board MCU through mikroBUSâ„¢ SPI (CS, SCK, MISO, MOSI), RDY and ACT lines. It uses a 3.3 V power supply only.
